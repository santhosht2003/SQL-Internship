#  Hospital Management System â€“ SQL Database 

This task is part of my SQL Developer Internship. It demonstrates how to design a relational database using MySQL Workbench for a Hospital Management System with 4 core entities.

##  Project Overview

This database simulates the workflow of a hospital by managing:

- Patient registration
- Doctor assignments
- Departmental structure
- Appointment scheduling

##  SQL Features Used

- `CREATE TABLE` with `PRIMARY KEY`, `AUTO_INCREMENT`
