#  Hospital Management System

This task is part of my SQL Developer Internship. It includes the creation and management of a simple hospital database using MySQL. The task demonstrates SQL skills such as creating tables, inserting data, updating records, and deleting data.

---

##  Project Overview

The database models basic operations in a hospital:
- Managing doctors and departments
- Storing patient details
- Performing basic CRUD operations

---

##  Tables

1. **Department**
2. **Doctor**
3. **Patient**

---

##  Relationships

- Each **Doctor** belongs to a **Department** via a foreign key.
- Each **Patient** is stored independently, and appointment functionality can be added later.

##  SQL Operations

### âœ” Create Database & Tables
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Hospital;
USE HospitalDB;

SET phone_number = '9998887776'
WHERE doctor_id = 1;

UPDATE Patient
SET address = 'Salem, Tamil Nadu'
WHERE patient_id = 3;

DELETE FROM Doctor
WHERE department_id = 3;

DELETE FROM Patient
WHERE patient_id = 2;
